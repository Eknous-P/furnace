# to-do

- finish color import improvements (settings refactor)
- new undo stuff
- fix some bugs
- finish auto-clone

once you have done all of this (maybe not the first one), release 0.6.1

# and then

- new oscilloscope renderer - custom code that uses texture and fixes two issues: too many vertices, and broken anti-aliasing
- new pattern renderer - performance improvements

## unrelated rthp todo:

- fix (catch) crash when unplugging erthp client
- fix vgm exports
- do something about streamed pcm chips
- abstract impl
- docs?
- more gui work
- - show error messages
- - "manual" io (a la debug playground)
- desubmodulize `serial`
